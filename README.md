# Slap That Button

In my adventures of learning hardware through the Raspberry Pi Zero, I have created the best/worst contraption.
When the button is pressed, the bassline from "Seinfeld" will play, as well as an LED turning on, cause why not?

## Installation and Usage

Uhh.... download it and then run ``python3 slapThatBass.py``
Just make sure to keep the .mp3 in the same directory.

## Credits

It was all my dumb idea... all mine!
